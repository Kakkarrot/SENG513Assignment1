        Since this is a SENG course, I figured I should include some of my work from related SENG classes.
        Below, I've listed a couple SENG courses I've taken in the past year, with one notable
        project from each course.

                    Software architecture was a very interesting course about how common frameworks
                    can be used to design a more efficient system. However, this is nothing regarding.
