        Since this is a SENG course, I figured I should include some of my work from related SENG classes.
        Below, I've listed a couple SENG courses I've taken in the past year, with one notable
        project from each course.

                    Software architecture was a very interesting course about how common frameworks
                    can be used to design a more efficient system. Although this can be overlooked
                    in smaller systems such as personal projects, they help to enhance the performance
                    and maintainability of a larger code base.

                    I wrote the following paper so please read it.

                    I made up this class because why not. I wonder why our course codes are only 3 digits long.
                    Never really understood this system. For example, why doesn't SENG 1 exist? That should
                    be the beginner level course for software engineering.

                    This is where I link a youtube video below even though the link description says otherwise.

                    This course is about requirements engineering. Interestingly enough, not all courses involve programming.
                    This is because engineering isn't just about coding. There is a considerable amount of design work
                    that needs to go into every project, which is often overlooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, I have included a design document from one of the assignments of the class, of which
                    I worked on with my friends.

                    This class was one of the first engineering classes I took online due to COVID.
                    There isn't much to say about this class other than the content closes resembles
                    that of a second year business class. Of course, in that class, we go into less
                    detail but the key concepts about process management are prevalent in both courses.

                    Here is a diagram I made in that class. It's very colorful
