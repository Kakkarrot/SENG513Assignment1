        Why isn't there a picture of me you ask? Because I do not exist. What other reason
        would there be for a missing picture. Back in my day, we didn't have cameras so we had
        to draw things in order to remember what they looked like. I happen to possess
        zero artistic talent, so I can only draw using three colors. Don't believe me?
        Try contacting me below. I have both my phone number and email address listed.
        Pity neither of those work. The only way to communicate with me is through telepathy.
